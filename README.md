# Ralph

![Ralph](ralph.webp)

Ralph is an autonomous AI agent loop that runs [Tabnine CLI](https://github.com/codota/tabnine-cli/) repeatedly until all PRD items are complete. Each iteration is a fresh Tabnine CLI instance with clean context. Memory persists via git history, `progress.txt`, and `prd.json`.

Tabnine CLI is a Gemini-based AI coding assistant that provides similar capabilities to Anthropic's Claude.

Based on [Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph pattern](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/).

## Prerequisites

- [Tabnine CLI](https://github.com/codota/tabnine-cli/) installed and authenticated
- `jq` installed (`brew install jq` on macOS)
- A git repository for your project

## Setup

### Copy to your project

Copy the ralph files into your project:

```bash
# From your project root
mkdir -p scripts/ralph
cp /path/to/ralph/ralph.sh scripts/ralph/
cp /path/to/ralph/prompt.md scripts/ralph/
chmod +x scripts/ralph/ralph.sh
```

## Workflow

### 1. Create a PRD

Create a detailed requirements document manually or with assistance from Tabnine CLI. See `skills/prd/SKILL.md` for guidelines on creating effective PRDs.

Save the PRD as `tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`.

### 2. Convert PRD to Ralph format

Convert the markdown PRD to JSON format using the guidelines in `skills/ralph/SKILL.md`. You can ask Tabnine CLI to help with this conversion.

This creates `prd.json` with user stories structured for autonomous execution.

### 3. Run Ralph

```bash
./scripts/ralph/ralph.sh [max_iterations]
```

Default is 10 iterations.

Ralph will:
1. Create a feature branch (from PRD `branchName`)
2. Pick the highest priority story where `passes: false`
3. Implement that single story
4. Run quality checks (typecheck, tests)
5. Commit if checks pass
6. Update `prd.json` to mark story as `passes: true`
7. Append learnings to `progress.txt`
8. Repeat until all stories pass or max iterations reached

## Critical Concepts

### Each Iteration = Fresh Context

Each iteration spawns a **new Tabnine CLI instance** with clean context. The only memory between iterations is:
- Git history (commits from previous iterations)
- `progress.txt` (learnings and context)
- `prd.json` (which stories are done)

### Small Tasks

Each PRD item should be small enough to complete in one context window. If a task is too big, the LLM runs out of context before finishing and produces poor code.

Right-sized stories:
- Add a database column and migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic
- Add a filter dropdown to a list

Too big (split these):
- "Build the entire dashboard"
- "Add authentication"
- "Refactor the API"

### AGENTS.md Updates Are Critical

After each iteration, Ralph updates the relevant `AGENTS.md` files with learnings. These files provide context for future iterations and human developers about discovered patterns, gotchas, and conventions.

Examples of what to add to AGENTS.md:
- Patterns discovered ("this codebase uses X for Y")
- Gotchas ("do not forget to update Z when changing W")
- Useful context ("the settings panel is in component X")

### Feedback Loops

Ralph only works if there are feedback loops:
- Typecheck catches type errors
- Tests verify behavior
- CI must stay green (broken code compounds across iterations)

### Browser Verification for UI Stories

Frontend stories should include manual browser verification in acceptance criteria. After Ralph implements UI changes, verify the changes work as expected in the browser.

### Stop Condition

When all stories have `passes: true`, Ralph outputs `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` and the loop exits.

## Debugging

Check current state:

```bash
# See which stories are done
cat prd.json | jq '.userStories[] | {id, title, passes}'

# See learnings from previous iterations
cat progress.txt

# Check git history
git log --oneline -10
```

## Customizing prompt.md

Edit `prompt.md` to customize Ralph's behavior for your project:
- Add project-specific quality check commands
- Include codebase conventions
- Add common gotchas for your stack

## Archiving

Ralph automatically archives previous runs when you start a new feature (different `branchName`). Archives are saved to `archive/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`.
